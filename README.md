## Redox CLI

Take home assignment from Redox. The assignment was to find out how many pull request the _ramda_ organization currently has by building a CLI using Node.js. If you move forward in the interview process, you'll have to parce through the PRs array. Example: filter through PRs from a certain date range.

To grab the total PRs for a repository use `-t <orgName>`

To fetch all PRs for a repository use `-n <orgName>`
